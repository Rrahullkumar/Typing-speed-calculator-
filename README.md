The problem is to design and develop a Typing Speed Test 
Application that allows users to evaluate their typing speed 
and accuracy. The application should cater to users of various 
skill levels, from beginners to experienced typists, by offering 
different difficulty levels. The Typing Speed Test Application 
should be user-friendly, providing a straightforward and 
interactive platform for users to take typing tests and receive 
immediate feedback on their performance. 
1. User-Friendly Interface: The application must feature an 
intuitive, Graphic user interface that allows users to select their 
desired difficulty level, take typing tests, and access their results 
easily. 
2. WPM Calculation: The Typing Speed Test should calculate the 
user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on the 
number of words typed and the time taken. 
3. Random Passages: The Typing Speed Test should present users 
with random text passages. These passages should be engaging and 
diverse, offering a range of complexity. 
4. Countdown Timer: The application must include a countdown 
timer that starts when the user begins typing. The timer measures 
the time taken to complete the passage accurately. 
5. Difficulty Levels: The application must provide different
different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) to suit users with 
different typing skills and experience.
